# Training Code
1. The submission includes the saved model weights of the successful agent.
- [x] A completed task Please submit the weights of the successful agent.

# Report 
1.  The submission includes a file in the root of the GitHub repository (one of Report.md, Report.ipynb, or Report.pdf) that provides a description of the implementation.
- [x] A completed task Please also submit project report covering details of the implementation.
2. The report clearly describes the learning algorithm, along with the chosen hyperparameters. It also describes the model architectures for any neural networks.
- [x] Please make sure to include the learning algorithm, hyperparameters, and neural network architectures in the notebook.
3. The submission has concrete future ideas for improving the agent's performance.
- [x] Please also include some ideas in the report to experiment with the agent in future.
